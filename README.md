# Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.

### Constraints

* Can we assume the string is ASCII?
    * Yes
    * Note: Unicode strings could require special handling depending on your language
* Can we assume this is case sensitive?
    * Yes
* Can we use additional data structures?
    * Yes
* Can we assume this fits in memory?
    * Yes
    
    
    **Instructions:**
* Program should be written in file build.py
* Function name should be has_unique_chars.
* Input 
      
       Type:  String
       Value: 'AbkLCsfjXwZmpdFEo'
       
* Expected Output
